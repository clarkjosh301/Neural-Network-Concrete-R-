I use a nueral network model inorder to predict the strength of concrete based off numerous variables including fly ash, amount of water, 
furnace slag, and coarseness. I decide to use a nueral network model since there is a bunch of data and a lot of the variables have no 
inherent obvious correlation to use a traditional alogorithm/machine learning model.
